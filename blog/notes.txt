Things to do:

1. Make form inform user if their post title has been used before - fixed slug so that user can have multiple posts with same title but different date time
2. Delete media if post deleted - fixed with django cleanup
3. Search by title and search by tags - done, basics implemented. for more advanced, need to learn ajax
4. User profile and following and fix user registration form - user profile done ( weird bug of abstractbaseuser to be analysed)
5. Rating for posts - changing to upvote system
